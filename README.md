# TRACON-Level AI Agent for Air Traffic Control Simulation

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a high-fidelity AI agent capable of demonstrating TRACON-level decision-making within a realistic air traffic control simulation environment. The focus is on building core functionality and showcasing intelligence through technical milestones.

## Current Status
**Phase 1: Building the Simulation Sandbox**
**Step 1: High-Fidelity Simulator Setup (BlueSky)**
We are currently setting up the foundational simulation environment using BlueSky.

## Motivation
My interest lies in applying advanced AI techniques to critical real-world systems, specifically in enhancing safety and efficiency within air traffic management. This project serves as a practical demonstration of building complex intelligent systems.

## Technologies Used
* **Core:** Python
* **Simulation:** BlueSky Simulator
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Installation & Setup (Under Development)
Detailed instructions for setting up the simulation environment will be provided here as the project progresses.
